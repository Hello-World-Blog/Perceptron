# Perceptron
Perceptron is a simple model of a single layered Artficial Neural Network that works for binary classification problems.    
  This repository is the implementation of a perceptron model from scratch in python and gives us an sample usage using two-class iris data.
# Dataset Description

The dataset (iris.csv) contains a set of 100 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species)
